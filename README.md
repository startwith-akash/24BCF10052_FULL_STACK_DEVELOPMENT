Title-To develop an admin dashboard with CSS Grid layout and dynamic theme switching.

---

Approach-

In this experiment, an Admin Dashboard interface was designed and developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The main objective was to create a clean dashboard layout along with a functional Light and Dark theme toggle.

* HTML was used to structure the dashboard into header, sidebar, main content, and footer sections.
* CSS Grid was implemented to create a responsive and organized layout.
* JavaScript was used to handle the theme toggle functionality.
* The selected theme preference is stored using localStorage, ensuring that the chosen theme persists even after refreshing the page.

This approach helps in understanding layout design, theme management, and the practical use of localStorage in web development.
